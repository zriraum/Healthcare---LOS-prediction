# Healthcare---LOS-prediction
Csv file contains the data that was worked upon and the jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the project. The aim of this project was to develop and test models that could predict the length of
stay of patients in a hospital, based on their condition and several other parameters. This would be useful, as it could help the hospital allocate resources optimally by planning ahead of time beacuse
the patient's duration of stay is known beforehand.
